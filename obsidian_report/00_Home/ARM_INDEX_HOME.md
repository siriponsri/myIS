# ArmIndex Home

ArmIndex is the active campaign. Historical SCOPE and P1 evidence remains readable but is not current ArmIndex evidence.

## Campaign and phase status

- Campaign: `armindex-multiretriever-v2`
- Phase: `A0_MIGRATION_FOUNDATION`
- Status: `active_migration`

## Retrieval arms

| Arm | Model | Adapter | Representation | Commercial status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ARM-01` | `lexical/bm25s` | declared_pending_fixture_lock | not_started | commercial_capable |
| `ARM-02` | `BAAI/bge-m3` | declared_pending_fixture_lock | not_started | commercial_capable |
| `ARM-03` | `datalyes/patembed-large` | declared_pending_fixture_lock | not_started | research_non_commercial |
| `ARM-04` | `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v2.0` | declared_pending_fixture_lock | not_started | commercial_capable |
| `ARM-05` | `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` | declared_pending_fixture_lock | not_started | commercial_capable |

## Optimization status

- Transfer: `not_started`
- Complementarity: `not_started`
- HarnessOpt: `not_started`
- Research champion: `None`
- Commercial champion: `None`

## Integrity and gates

- Measured runs: `0`
- Selection exposures: `0`
- Final exposures: `0`
- D2 and D3 remain Owner-only.
- Final remains closed.

## Next command

`/goal Execute ArmIndex A0 compute-feasibility fixtures and preflight from the canonical PLAN and control/campaigns/armindex-multiretriever-v2.yaml. Use synthetic fixtures only; do not start measured retrieval, download model weights, open Selection, or open Final.`

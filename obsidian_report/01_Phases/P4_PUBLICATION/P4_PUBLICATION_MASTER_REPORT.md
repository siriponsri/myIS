# P4_PUBLICATION

Generated from the validated report record. Manual edits may be replaced; use the separate Owner Notes area for personal annotations.

## Objective

Deliver the P4_PUBLICATION research phase with an auditable evidence boundary.

## Starting State

- `phase`: P2_SCOPE_DEVELOPMENT
- `task`: P2.1
- `program_state`: P1_CPU_MEASURED_COMPLETE
- `authorization`: D1_START_CAMPAIGN; D2/D3 remain Owner-only
- `claim_boundary`: No unsupported scientific claim

## Inputs and Frozen Bindings

- `source_of_truth`: `control/source-of-truth.yaml`; SHA-256 `27cdd4ddbe84d69985616c689a65191a78e9461f4c0e99d9b48e90bfc681ba11`
- `campaign`: `control/campaigns/scope-autoindex-v1.yaml`; SHA-256 `a86d73657988713d62ddfb12c9c01da367af2e97922363233ef8cd453fb20ce9`
- `git_commit`: 8b4b3d6f39aa06580fc2c46743ea7fad8f5f390e

## Work Performed

This report is generated from validated canonical records; planning, implementation, review, fixture, measured execution, and reporting are kept distinct.

## Artifacts Produced

These references explain what each artifact is for; the bytes remain governed by canonical paths.

| Artifact | Type | Evidence | Safe URI | SHA-256 | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | - | - | - | - | - |

## Metrics

| Metric | Split | Scope | Value | n | Denominator | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| No measured metric is available | - | - | - | - | - | planned/fixture |

Fixture values are synthetic engineering diagnostics and are never reported as measured performance.

## Result

**Output:** No execution output is available because the phase is locked behind its Owner decision.

**Result:** The phase remains planned and closed.

**Decision:** waiting_owner

## Interpretation

No interpretation is available before the required gate and evidence.

## Supported Claims

- No execution output is available because the phase is locked behind its Owner decision.

## Unsupported Claims

- Measured P2 improvement or candidate superiority before a real measured run.
- Final-split generalization or publication release before D2 and D3.
- Causal or legal conclusions from retrieval aggregates.

## Failures and Recovery

- No material failure is recorded for this Phase or Task.

## Governance and Safety

- `protected_data_accessed`: False
- `measured_execution`: False
- `gpu`: False
- `paid_api`: False
- `network_model_download`: False
- `provider_fallback`: False
- `d2`: waiting_owner
- `d3`: waiting_owner
- `final_split`: closed
- `real_counters`: `{"candidate_count": 0, "final_accesses": 0, "measured_runs": 0, "selection_accesses": 0, "shortlist_count": 0}`
- `evidence_class`: planned
- `scientific_authority`: False

## Decision

Status: **waiting_owner**. The phase remains planned and closed.

## Next Action

/goal Run the Owner-local A1.2 artifact-manifest and external-termination dry-run preflight on CPU. Validate complete SHA256SUMS manifests for the four dense arms, freeze byte hashes for Snowflake remote code and the Qwen measured maximum length, bind a live quote and provider instance identity, and prove provider termination/TTL without exposing credentials or protected payloads. Do not reserve GPU capacity or start measured retrieval until every launch-checklist item passes and the unchanged execution contract is explicitly adopted.

Measured P2, real selection, and final evaluation must not start automatically from this report.

## Evidence Links

- None recorded.

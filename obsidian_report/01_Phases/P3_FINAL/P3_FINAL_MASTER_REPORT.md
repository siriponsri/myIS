# P3_FINAL

Generated from the validated report record. Manual edits may be replaced; use the separate Owner Notes area for personal annotations.

## Objective

Deliver the P3_FINAL research phase with an auditable evidence boundary.

## Starting State

- `phase`: P2_SCOPE_DEVELOPMENT
- `task`: P2.1
- `program_state`: P1_CPU_MEASURED_COMPLETE
- `authorization`: D1_START_CAMPAIGN; D2/D3 remain Owner-only
- `claim_boundary`: No unsupported scientific claim

## Inputs and Frozen Bindings

- `source_of_truth`: `control/source-of-truth.yaml`; SHA-256 `fd8ebce49e2973bfcef1f67624f3c7f93807fc4192ed29de1947e8e71dc72299`
- `campaign`: `control/campaigns/scope-autoindex-v1.yaml`; SHA-256 `a86d73657988713d62ddfb12c9c01da367af2e97922363233ef8cd453fb20ce9`
- `git_commit`: 551bee74eee0dbcf6ad815e78d474d8e707878f4

## Work Performed

This report is generated from validated canonical records; planning, implementation, review, fixture, measured execution, and reporting are kept distinct.

## Artifacts Produced

These references explain what each artifact is for; the bytes remain governed by canonical paths.

| Artifact | Type | Evidence | Safe URI | SHA-256 | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | - | - | - | - | - |

## Metrics

| Metric | Split | Scope | Value | n | Denominator | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| No measured metric is available | - | - | - | - | - | planned/fixture |

Fixture values are synthetic engineering diagnostics and are never reported as measured performance.

## Result

**Output:** No execution output is available because the phase is locked behind its Owner decision.

**Result:** The phase remains planned and closed.

**Decision:** waiting_owner

## Interpretation

No interpretation is available before the required gate and evidence.

## Supported Claims

- No execution output is available because the phase is locked behind its Owner decision.

## Unsupported Claims

- Measured P2 improvement or candidate superiority before a real measured run.
- Final-split generalization or publication release before D2 and D3.
- Causal or legal conclusions from retrieval aggregates.

## Failures and Recovery

- No material failure is recorded for this Phase or Task.

## Governance and Safety

- `protected_data_accessed`: False
- `measured_execution`: False
- `gpu`: False
- `paid_api`: False
- `network_model_download`: False
- `provider_fallback`: False
- `d2`: waiting_owner
- `d3`: waiting_owner
- `final_split`: closed
- `real_counters`: `inline`; SHA-256 `None`
- `evidence_class`: planned
- `scientific_authority`: False

## Decision

Status: **waiting_owner**. The phase remains planned and closed.

## Next Action

/goal Execute A0.8_COMPUTE_AND_STORAGE_FEASIBILITY_FIXTURES from the canonical PLAN and control/campaigns/armindex-multiretriever-v2.yaml. Use synthetic fixtures only; do not access protected data, start measured retrieval, download model weights, use GPU or paid APIs, open Selection, or open Final.

Measured P2, real selection, and final evaluation must not start automatically from this report.

## Evidence Links

- None recorded.

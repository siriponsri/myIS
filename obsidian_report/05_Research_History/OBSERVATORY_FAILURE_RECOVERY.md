# Observatory Failure and Recovery

The synthetic fixture intentionally retained one failed child and its recovery record. The failure did not change real counters or promote an incomplete metric.

- Failed child records: `1`
- Recovery records: `1`
- Negative checks passed: `True`

## Captured lineage

- Failure `obs-failure-candidate-02` at `candidate_generation` / class `synthetic_timeout`; checkpoint `candidate-02-start`; counters before/after `{'candidate_count': 1, 'measured_runs': 0, 'selection_accesses': 0, 'shortlist_count': 0}` -> `{'candidate_count': 1, 'measured_runs': 0, 'selection_accesses': 0, 'shortlist_count': 0}`; protected data accessed `False`.
- Recovery `obs-recovery-candidate-02` for `obs-failure-candidate-02`: `retry_from_checkpoint`; validation `passed`; metric promotion `False`; residual risk `No scientific metric promotion`.

## Lesson

A failed branch remains useful evidence when the checkpoint, retry action, and claim boundary are recorded together. This is a capture-readiness lesson, not evidence about retrieval quality.

# P2 SCOPE Development Result

## Result

P2 is ready/planned but not measured. This note deliberately contains no scientific metric.

Owner-local preflight state is **not_started** and remains separate from measured execution.

## Fixture evidence

The repository-only synthetic fixture is `passed`. It exercised `32` synthetic candidates across `5` adaptive iterations, froze `4` synthetic finalists, and used `1` fixture-only selection exposure. This is engineering evidence, not retrieval-quality evidence.

## Method rationale and references

The baseline family BM25 arm (`R0`) establishes a transparent comparator (U006, U011; see [[LITERATURE_INDEX]]). The 512-token window/MaxP arm (`R0-W`) tests passage granularity without changing the evaluator (U154). The planned R1 arm follows AutoIndex-style representation-program search and keeps the same retrieval/evaluation boundary so the scientific contrast is representation, not provider or model substitution (U154, U011).

## Interpretation boundary

Readiness proves that the execution contract is explicit; it does not prove that R1 improves retrieval. A budget stop or no-improvement stop is a valid negative development outcome.

## Official review boundary

Round `3` is **accept** for static contract safety. Evidence class is `static_contract_review` and the claim boundary is `engineering_provenance_only`. See [[P2_OFFICIAL_REVIEW_AUDIT]].

## Freeze rule

Baseline reproduction, train evaluation, and freeze validation must pass before selection. Selection is unavailable until a validated immutable shortlist-freeze receipt exists, and it may be exposed only once. Final-872 remains closed.

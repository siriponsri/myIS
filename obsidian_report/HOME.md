# myIS Research Report

หน้านี้เป็น current view ที่สร้างจาก shared read model; PLAN.md และ canonical controls/receipts ยังคงเป็น authority.

## สถานะตอนนี้

- Phase: `A2_PER_ARM_AUTOINDEX`
- Task/Sub-stage: `A2.1 / FROZEN_FIVE_ARM_EXECUTION`
- Status: `a2_ready_for_ap_fresh_instance_staging_measured_a2_locked`
- Evidence: immutable candidate freeze and pre-measurement engineering readiness; A2 candidate evaluation and measured A2 are not started.

## หลักฐานและขอบเขต

- Scientific authority: `False`
- Claim boundary: `frozen_52_candidate_execution_readiness_only_no_candidate_evaluation_or_measured_a2_claim`
- A1 measured evidence remains historical canonical lineage; it does not make A2 measured.
- Selection and Final remain closed; D2 and D3 are Owner-only.

## การส่งต่องาน

- Latest implementation handoff: `docs/implementation/A2_PER_ARM_AUTOINDEX_im_004_001.md`
- Next authorized action: `AP_VALIDATE_OWNER_LOCAL_PUSHED_HEAD_BUNDLE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_RECEIPT_THEN_FRESH_INSTANCE_ADMISSION_AND_ISOLATED_STAGING`
- Use `uv run --no-sync myis-status` for the current canonical owner status.

## Historical P1 summary

Historical P1 state: `P1_CPU_MEASURED_COMPLETE`. Its validated aggregate evidence remains preserved without reinterpretation; see [[P1_CPU_BASELINE_RESULT]].

## Execution progress / observability

Historical P1 execution details remain in the canonical receipt-linked P1 report.
